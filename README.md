# <rework Study Guide Webpage>

## Description

My motivation to create this study guide was to help prepare for the coding bootcamp.
This project is to help organize information that you can refer to throughout the bootcamp.
This project makes your bootcamp notes easily accessible and a place to store all your notes.
I've learned basic HTML, CSS, JavaScript, Git. Most importantly I've learned the patience of debugging.
